# View

Depending on game state, different things are rendered.

- Out-game GUI renders the OutGame GUI object.
- In-game GUI renders the world, and a GUI object on top of it.
- Playing and Paused both render the world.

## World Rendering

## GUI

GUI objects are things that render on the screen and can be interacted with
by the player.
